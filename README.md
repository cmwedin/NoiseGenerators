# Noise Generators
This package is a collection of compute shaders that can generate various types of noise textures. This README is currently a placeholder and will be update as development continues

# Psuedo-Random Number generation approach

This package uses a "permuted congruential generator" (more commonly known as PCG) algorithm  as it lies on the pareto-fronter of random quality vs preformance (see [Hash Functions for GPU Rendering](https://jcgt.org/published/0009/03/02/)). The particular PCG procedure this package uses is: 

    uint pcg_hash(uint seed) {
        seed = seed * 747796405u + 2891336453u;
        seed = ((seed >> ((seed >> 28u) + 4u)) ^ seed) * 277803737u;
        return (seed >> 22u) ^ seed;
    }

we also include the following 3 -> 3 and 4 -> 4 hash methods, respectively: 

    uint3 pcg3d_hash(uint3 seed) {
        seed = seed * 1664525u + 1013904223u;
        seed.x += seed.y*seed.z; seed.y += seed.z*seed.x; seed.z += seed.x*seed.y;
        seed ^= seed >> 16u;
        seed.x += seed.y*seed.z; seed.y += seed.z*seed.x; seed.z += seed.x*seed.y;
        return seed;
    }
    uint4 pcg4d_hash(uint4 seed) {
        seed = seed * 1664525u + 1013904223u;
        seed.x += seed.y*seed.w; seed.y += seed.z*seed.x; seed.z += seed.x*seed.y; seed.w += seed.y*seed.z;
        seed ^= seed >> 16u;
        seed.x += seed.y*seed.w; seed.y += seed.z*seed.x; seed.z += seed.x*seed.y; seed.w += seed.y*seed.z;
        return seed;
    }

a 2d hash can be generated by discarding the z component of the 3d hash.
