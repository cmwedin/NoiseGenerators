# Noise Generators
This package is a collection of compute shaders that can generate various types of noise textures. This README is currently a placeholder and will be update as development continues

# Psuedo-Random Number generation approach

To be update with the methods used to generate psuedo-random numbers

# Random noise texture

uses random number directly to compute the noise

# Perlin noise texture
